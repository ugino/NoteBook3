# Todo App
This is a simple Todo app built using React and Next.js. It allows you to create and manage notes with a title and a body, and the notes are stored locally using the browser's localStorage.

The app uses the TinyMCE text editor to provide a rich editing experience for the note's body. TinyMCE is a popular WYSIWYG editor that provides a variety of formatting and customization options.
